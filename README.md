# Analyse people-descriptions
CFG-parser to identify semantic attributes in automatic image descriptions. Specifically, this parser analyses person-labels in descriptions generated by 9 different systems.

Note that this code is still being developed. If you want to reproduce the exact
numbers from the LANTERN publication, please refer to the [1.0 release](https://github.com/evanmiltenburg/AnalysePeopleDescriptions/releases/tag/1.0).

## Requirements
These are the software versions that we used. Other versions remain untested, and may give different results.

* Python 3.6.6
* NLTK 3.3
* SpaCy 2.0.4 with model 'en_core_web_sm'

## Contents

* `example.py` shows the basic usage of this resource.
* `/Full-example` shows how to use this resource to assess your own system output.
* `/Resources` contains:
    - The grammar and the scripts used to build the grammar.
    - The `Grammar/History` folder, which contains the previous versions of the lexicon, with the scripts that we used to compile the current version.
    - The `Grammar/Nouns` folder, which  contains the set of nouns used in our grammar. The grammar does not provide full coverage of all nouns, but rather aims to provide an accurate analysis for the nouns that are given.
    - The `Grammar/Other` folder, which  contains other terms that are essential for the grammar to work.
    - The `SystemOutputs` folder with scripts that were used for the LANTERN2020 workshop. (This is not very clean, and some day I may refactor the code.)

## Usage

Run `python example.py` to see an analysis of the sentence "There is a young man in the garden with a tall woman."
